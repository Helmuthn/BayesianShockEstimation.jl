This repository contains code related to an associated SSP 2023 submission.

It contains the required functions to reproduce the plots in the paper, using Monte Carlo integration to compute an approximate shock density.

Figure 1 is generated using the Pluto notebook in `notebooks`, while Figure 2 requires extensive simulations in `other_simulations`.
